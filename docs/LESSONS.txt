POSITIVES OF THE GROUP

1. Everyone willing to work and being a part of the project.
2. Effort put in by all was commendable.
3. Deadlines were properly met by all.


NEGATIVES OF THE GROUP

1. Non-uniform distribution of knowledge - not all members were at par in terms of knowledge when it comes to every segment/vertical.


What would we do differently next time?

Given a bit more time, next time every segment would be divided between all members. This way everyone gets to learn much more at every stage. So, at the end of the project everyone knows something new.
